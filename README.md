# ANDnXOR_DC33_Badge_Tool
A utility designed for the AND!XOR DC33 badge that enables users to extract (dump) all embedded files directly from the deviceâ€™s binary firmware. It also allows patching in new GIF animations into the binary, which can then be re-flashed back onto the badge using picotool -- making it easy to customize and update badge visuals.
